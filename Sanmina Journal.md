# Sanmina Journal

This is a simple journal describing the daily / weekly activities and accomplishments while on my In-Circuit Testing Coop at Sanmina, Summer 2018.

## May

**First day:** Lots of training [ESD, Workplace safety, etc]. Very thorough. They showed me my desk and introduced me to everyone. Kelvin game me tons of manuals for reference and started giving me an overview.

**Second Day:** Kelvin showed me how all the components work together to test the boards. We went over all the tools used, the file structure for the test suites, and keywords for the BT Basic tool used. Oleg started to show me how to debug a circuit, but we got sidetracked with a new fixture that did not function as expected.

**Third Day:** Starting to get everything working, and reading over some documents from Kelvin. Followed Oleg and learned about debugging tests. Learned how to recognize test failures due to short pins; the tests were fixed by adding long versions of the same pins. These tests are recognized by having consistent values [by observing recycled tests] which are lower than expected.

**Fourth Day:** Had my first ICT team meeting; we went through all the current projects and any issues we are experiencing. Reading through 'Agilent 3070 User Fundamentals' Volume 1. Writing notes in markdown helps reinforce and condense the information. Kelvin showing me more about the tests; things are finally making sense.

**Fifth Day:**
